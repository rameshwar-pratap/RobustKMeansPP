# RobustKMeansPP
Robust k-means++ implementation
Requires jupyter-notebook and python3 with numpy, scikit-learn installed.

The jupyter notebook includes three functions robust_kmeanspp, random_outliers, kmeanspp_outliers which implement our algorithm, vanilla kmeans++, vanilla random initializations respectively. Data should be a numpy matrix of nxd dimensions where n is the number of points and d is the data dimension. Rest of the inputs are self-explanatory.

The file also includes the sample experiments on various parameters.
